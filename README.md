3: Certain special days like Eid, the day of Arafah etc are highlighted

4: A list of moonsightings organisations are available and you can switch to and from the calendar of any given organisation. Data is available [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AbdullahM0hamed/HilalMonths/master/hilal-months.json)

5: A gregorian to hijri to date converter is available for the currently available months for a given organisation.

6: A small-print gregorian date is displayed next to the hijri dates on the calendar for ease of comparison.

# Wish to see another Moonsighting organisation added?

Please open an issue on this repository or on https://github.com/AbdullahM0hamed/HilalMonths. Please note that as of now I only plan to accept organisations that make announcements every month and are reliable year-round, though this may change in the future.
